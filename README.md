## Autocorrect

This package automatically corrects your typing mistakes in whatever language you prefer, via piggybacking on top of flyspell-autocorrect-word.  Currently, Autocorrect only works for org-mode and text-mode, but hopefully someday soon it'll support all modes that are derived from text mode.  Autocorrect can potentially work for programming modes, but only in the comment areas. Talk to your Doctor and see if Autocorrect is right for you.
